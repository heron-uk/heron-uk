# Conventions

Data in HERON-UK has been standardised to the OMOP CDM. When mapping to the OMOP CDM we recommend following the [OHDSI THEMIS Conventions](https://ohdsi.github.io/Themis/index.html). However, to ensure the greatest possible alignment within HERON-UK we have also developed additional conventions to ensure that we map to the OMOP CDM as consistently as possible. Please note that our conventions reflect the current onboarded data partners and are subject to change as and when additional data partners are added.

# Feedback

If any conventions are unclear, do not align well with your data, or if you see other areas needing a convention please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/heron-uk/heron-uk/issues).
