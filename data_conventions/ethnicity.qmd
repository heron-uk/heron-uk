# Ethnicity

Patient ethnicity is a valuable data element for research, and we encourage you to include ethnicity records in your OMOP CDM instance if available in your source data.

By convention, ethnicity is mapped using the [NHS Ethnic Category](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?vocabulary=NHS+Ethnic+Category&page=1&pageSize=15&query=) in two places: the *observation* table and the *person* table. This approach accommodates databases that may contain multiple ethnicity records per patient.

**Person Table**

Only one ethnicity record per person is allowed in the person table, to be populated as:
- `race_concept_id`: always set to 0, because the NHS Ethnic Category codes are non-standard.
- `race_source_concept_id`: populate with the most common code per person. If two or more codes occur with equal frequency, select the most recent one. If no ethnicity data is available for a person, set `race_source_concept_id` = 0.
