The database provides broad and longitudinal coverage of the English population and is widely used in observational research.\n\n\n\nGreat Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust is a specialist tertiary care paediatric hospital in the UK that receives children with complex and/or rare conditions. Many patients require long-term care and follow-up, resulting in highly detailed clinical data. The database includes over 200,000 patients with inpatient or outpatient encounters between April 2019 and February 2025.\n\n\n\nLeeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust contributes data on approximately 1.5 million patients with diagnoses or admissions since 2003.

It contributes a dataset of approximately 3 million patients from across its six hospitals in East London: The Royal London Hospital, Newham General Hospital, Whipps Cross Hospital, Mile End Hospital, St Bartholomew’s Hospital and the London NHS Nightingale Hospital, a purpose-built COVID-19 hospital.

    "title": "Creating observation periods",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the OMOP CDM, the observation period table defines\n\nspans of time during which two conditions are expected to hold: (i) Clinical Events that happened to the Person are recorded in the Event tables, and (ii) absence of records indicate such Events did not occur during this span of time. https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#observation_period\n\nThere are many nuances to defining observations periods, and different definitions can have a major impact on studies that rely on observation time (such as incidence and prevalence studies that require identifying a suitable denominator population, survival studies which require follow-up into the future, and so on).\nIn HERON-UK we have defined two conventions for constructing observation periods, depending on whether source data has a start and end date for individuals or not. In addition to these conventions, which are summarised below, we have also developed the OmopConstructor R package which can be used to manipulate observation periods on a study-by-study basis.\n\n\nIn some data sources, such as primary care data, enrollment/ registration and exit dates are available for individuals. In this case, we use these dates to set observation_period_start_date and observation_period_end_date, respectively. In the case where individuals have multiple entries into and exits out of the data, we keep only the first entry per person to define the observation period. (Note, in HERON-UK we do not have any insurance claims data where such a rule may be considered too stringent).\n\n\n\nIn many data sources, there is no defined start and exit date for individuals. In such cases, we define observation periods using the following approach:\n\nObservation period start date: the date of the first record for a person.\nObservation period end date: the earliest of the following:\n\nDate of death\nA censoring age (commonly 120 years, though this can vary; e.g., pediatric databases may use 18 years)\nOther censoring events, such as migration out of the study region.\nDate of data extraction\n\n\nThis definition results in a single observation period per person. (Note, all data partners in HERON-UK have mortality data - in the absence of death data, additional censoring rules would likely be needed).\nThis convention is designed to err on the side of including as much possible time for individuals. When running studies, however, the OmopConstructor package can be used to apply study-specific persistance and surveillance windows. See our OHDSI Europe 2025 poster for more information on approaches to and implications of methods for defining observation periods, and the OmopConstructor R package for implementing them on a study-by-study basis.\n\n\n\nWhere there are multiple source data that are being linked, we define observation periods as the time in which individuals can be observed in all datasets. For example, if data source A went from from 2014 to 2023 and data source B went from 2018 to 2025, then an OMOP CDM with linked data from A and B would be expected to have observation periods from 2018 to 2023."

For example, if data source A went from from 2014 to 2023 and data source B went from 2018 to 2025, then an OMOP CDM with linked data from A and B would be expected to have observation periods from 2018 to 2023."

The general population CDM contains person records drawn from the Lothian subsets of 4 national datasets: PHS Scottish Morbidity Records SMR00, SMR01, and SMR06, and the PIS dataset for prescribing information. These patients have been linked to historical coded data for hospitalisations, drug prescriptions, laboratory results, SIMD quintiles, GP data for BMI, alcohol consumption and smoking status, and deaths data from the National Records of Scotland. The dataset covers a geographical area in South East Scotland with a population of approximately 900k individuals.\nGOSH is a specialist tertiary care paediatrics hospital in the UK receiving children with complex and/or rare conditions. A large proportion of the children that we see typically require long-term care and follow up at GOSH. This results in data collected during routine healthcare that are very rich in number of variables and detail\nMulti-source secondary care dataset\nLTHT OMOP database\n-\n\n\nDocumentation reference\n-\nETL Document reference\nhttps://dataloch.org/data\n-\nhttp://omop-lsc.surge.sh/\nNot available - source is PPM\n-\n\n\nSource type\nsql server\nsql server\nsql server\nsql server\nsql server\nsql server\npostgresql"
